--> Hello! My name is Brandon, and I'm a current freshman at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm from Los Angeles, California, and I'm in the engineering school majoring in computer science. I like to play sports, watch movies, try new foods, hang out with friends, and code! Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me!
